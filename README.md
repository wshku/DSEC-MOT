# DSEC-MOT

### About
Welcome to the new challenging event-based multi-object tracking dataset (DSEC-MOT) repository! Our goal is to provide a challenging and diverse event-based MOT dataset with various real-world scenarios to facilitate the objective and comphrehensive evaluation of event-based multi-object tracking algorithms. This dataset, built upon [DSEC](https://dsec.ifi.uzh.ch/), contains a variety of traffic entities, complex scenarios, and high-quality annotations, aiming to address the current lack of event-based MOT datasets.
